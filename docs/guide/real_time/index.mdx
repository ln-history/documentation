This version collects and inserts collected gossip messages in *real time* into the _ln-history-database_.

Please note that this version is more difficult to setup, since it consists of multiple micro services.


## Architecture

You will have to have a running [Core Lightning node](https://corelightning.org/).

First we will configure the [Core Lightning node](https://corelightning.org/) to run the [gossip-publisher-zmq](./gossip_publisher_zmq) plugin.
The plugin publishes the collected gossip messages via a Zero Message Queue to the [gossip-syncer](./gossip_syncer) micro-service.
The gossip messages get filtered and then produced to a [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) instance. 
The [gossip-post-processor](./gossip_post_processor) subscribes from this service and inserts the collected data into the _ln-history-database_.
