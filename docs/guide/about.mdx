# About

This project is one of many projects of [summer of bitcoin 2025](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/).

Together with my mentor [René Pickhardt](https://https://rene-pickhardt.de/) I built this project: **_ln-history_**.
I want to thank him a lot for his valuable support!

I also want to thank [Dr. Christian Decker](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=ZaeGlZIAAAAJ&hl=de) for collecting and providing the data as well as my professor [Prof. Dr. Stefan Schmid](https://schmiste.github.io/).
